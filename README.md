# ATM Project

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>This is a simple program utilizing React to validate input.  This project resembles an ATM, allowing the user to add as much as they want, but limiting how much they can take out based off of what is available.  From the original code I recieved, I added a warning at the bottom of the page.  This warning will pop up when you attempt to take out more money than the account has stored.  I also added some more line spacing to make the code a little easier to read.</p>

<h2>How to Run:</h2>
<p>After installing the files run the command prompt, navigate to the containing folder, and run a local host server.  Accessing localhost:8080 will then open the page.</p>
